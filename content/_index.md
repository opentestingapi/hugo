# Open Testing API

The OpenTestingAPI is an open source initiative to harmonise the testing process over modern platforms. 
Goal is to establish a standard for testing definition which can easily be used with several tools, supporting backend and frontend development.

## Features

* **Simple**: Develop and apply testcases can be performed by nearby everyone
* **Flexible**: The concept is not restricted to technical platforms. It's explicitly designed for extension. 
* **Modern**: Testcases are designed in JSON, which is simple to read and supported by a wide range of technologies. This allows a simple integration into new and already existing tools.
